#### Lessons

1. [Hoon Syntax](/guides/core/hoon-school/B-syntax) - This module will discuss the fundamental data concepts of Hoon and how programs effect control flow.
2. [Azimuth](/guides/core/hoon-school/C-azimuth) - This module introduces how Urbit ID is structured and provides practice in converting and working with `@p` identity points.
3. [Gates (Functions)](/guides/core/hoon-school/D-gates) - This module will teach you how to produce deferred computations for later use, like functions in other languages.
4. [Molds (Types)](/guides/core/hoon-school/E-types) - This module will introduce the Hoon type system and illustrate how type checking and type inference work.
5. [Cores](/guides/core/hoon-school/F-cores) - This module will introduce the key Hoon data structure known as the **core**, as well as ramifications.
6. [Trees & Addressing](/guides/core/hoon-school/G-trees) - This module will elaborate how we can use the structure of nouns to locate data and evaluate code in a given expression.  It will also discuss the important `list` mold builder and a number of standard library operations.
7. [Libraries](/guides/core/hoon-school/H-libraries) - This module will discuss how libraries can be produced, imported, and used.
8. [Testing Code](/guides/core/hoon-school/I-testing) - This module will discuss how we can have confidence that a program does what it claims to do, using unit testing and debugging strategies.
9. [Text Processing I](/guides/core/hoon-school/J-stdlib-text) - This module will discuss how text is represented in Hoon, discuss tools for producing and manipulating text, and introduce the `%say` generator, a new generator type.
10. [Cores & Doors](/guides/core/hoon-school/K-doors) - This module will start by introducing the concept of gate-building gates; then it will expand our notion of cores to include doors; finally it will introduce a common door, the `++map`, to illustrate how doors work.
11. [Data Structures](/guides/core/hoon-school/L-struct) - This module will introduce you to several useful data structures built on the door, then discuss how the compiler handles types and the sample.
12. [Type Checking](/guides/core/hoon-school/M-typecheck) - This module will cover how the Hoon compiler infers type, as well as various cases in which a type check is performed.
13. [Conditional Logic](/guides/core/hoon-school/N-logic) - This module will cover the nature of loobean logic and the rest of the `?` wut runes.
14. [Subject-Oriented Programming](/guides/core/hoon-school/O-subject) - This module discusses how Urbit's subject-oriented programming paradigm structures how cores and values are used and maintain state, as well as how deferred computations and remote value lookups (“scrying”) are handled.
15. [Text Processing II](/guides/core/hoon-school/P-stdlib-io) - This module will elaborate on text representation in Hoon, including formatted text, and `%ask` generators.
16. [Functional Programming](/guides/core/hoon-school/Q-func) - This module will discuss some gates-that-work-on-gates and other assorted operators that are commonly recognized as functional programming tools.  It will also cover text parsing.
17. [Adaptive Cores](/guides/core/hoon-school/R-metals) - This module introduces how cores can be extended for different behavioral patterns.
18. [Mathematics](/guides/core/hoon-school/S-math) - This module introduces how non-`@ud` mathematics are instrumented in Hoon.
