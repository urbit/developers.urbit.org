The `arvo.hoon` file primarily contains the basic event processing and routing
machinery of Arvo, but it also defines a number of useful types and other
functions. Some of these have been excluded as they're obscure types only used
internally by Arvo, but the rest are documented below.

## `+$arch`

Node identity

This represents a node in Clay, which may be a file or a directory.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  arch  (axil @uvI)
```

#### Examples

```
> *arch
[fil=~ dir={}]

> .^(arch %cy %/sys)
[ fil=~
    dir
  { [p=~.hoon q=~]
    [p=~.lull q=~]
    [p=~.kelvin q=~]
    [p=~.vane q=~]
    [p=~.arvo q=~]
    [p=~.zuse q=~]
  }
]

[   fil
  [ ~

  ]
  dir={}
]
```

---

## `++axal`

Fundamental node, recursive

This mold builder creates a representation of a node in Clay like an
[`arch`](#arch) or [`axil`](#axil), but the directory map contains more `axal`s,
so it contains the entire subtree rather than just one level.

#### Source

```hoon
++  axal
  |$  [item]
  [fil=(unit item) dir=(map @ta $)]
```

#### Examples

```
> *(axal @uvI)
[fil=~ dir={}]

  |-
  =+  .^(=arch %cy (en-beam [our %base da+now] path))

## `+$beak`

Global context

This is the unencoded global path prefix for a node in Clay. It's a triple of a
[`ship`](#ship), [`desk`](#desk) and [`case`](#case). The `case` is a revision
reference.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  beak  (trel ship desk case)
```

#### Examples

```
> *beak
[p=~zod q=%$ r=[%ud p=0]]

> `beak`[our %base da+now]
[p=~zod q=%base r=[%da p=~2022.11.8..10.16.14..757a]]

> `beak`[our %base ud+1]
[p=~zod q=%base r=[%ud p=1]]

> `beak`[our %base tas+'foo']
[p=~zod q=%base r=[%tas p=%foo]]
```

---

## `+$beam`

Global name

An unencoded global path to a node in Clay. The [`beak`](#beak) denotes the
[`ship`](#ship), [`desk`](#desk) and [`case`](#case) (revision reference), and
then `s` is the path to the node therein.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  beam  [beak s=path]
```

#### Examples

```
> *beam
[[p=~zod q=%$ r=[%ud p=0]] s=/]

## `+$bone`

Opaque duct handle

This is used by Ames to identify a particular message flow over the network.

> .^([snd=(set bone) rcv=(set bone)] %ax /=//=/bones/~nes)
[snd={0} rcv={}]
```

---

## `+$case`

Global version

A reference to a particular revision in Clay. It may be one of:

- `%da`: a date.
- `%tas`: a label (these are seldom used).
- `%ud`: a revision number. The initial commit is 1, and then each subsequent
  commit increments it.

```hoon
+$  case
  $%  [%da p=@da]
      [%tas p=@tas]
      [%ud p=@ud]
  ==
```

#### Examples

```
> *case
[%ud p=0]

> `case`ud+123
[%ud p=123]

> `case`tas+'foo'
[%tas p=%foo]

> `case`da+now
[%da p=~2022.11.8..10.57.44..0e31]
```

---

## `+$cage`

Marked vase

A pair of a [`mark`](#mark) and a [`vase`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/4o#vase)
(type-value pair). These are extensively used for passing data around between
vanes and agents.

#### Source

```hoon

```

#### Example

```
> *cage
[p=%$ q=[#t/* q=0]]

[p=%noun q=[#t/@t q=7.303.014]]
```

---

## `++cask`

Marked data builder

Like a [`cage`](#cage) except rather than a `vase`, the tail is whatever type
was given to the mold builder. These are most frequently used for sending data
over the network, as vases can only be used locally.

++  cask  |$  [a]  (pair mark a)
```

#### Examples

```
> *(cask)
[p=%$ q=0]

> *(cask @t)

## `+$ball`

Dynamic kernel action

This contains the action or response in a kernel [`move`](#move). One of:

- `[%hurl [%error-tag stack-trace] wite=pass-or-gift]`: action failed; error.
- `[%pass wire=/vane-name/etc note=[vane=%vane-name task=[%.y p=vase]]]`:
  advance; request.
- `[%slip note=[vane=%vane-name task=[%.y p=vase]]]`: lateral; make a request as
  though you're a different vane.
- `[%give gift=[%.y vase]`: retreat; response.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  ball  (wite [vane=term task=maze] maze)
```

#### Examples

```
> *ball
[%give gift=[%.y p=[#t/* q=0]]]
```

---

## `+$card`

#### Source

```hoon
+$  card  (cask)
```

#### Examples

```
> *card
[p=%$ q=0]
```

---

## `+$duct`

Causal history

Arvo is designed to avoid the usual state of complex event networks: event
spaghetti. We keep track of every event's cause so that we have a clear causal
chain for every computation. At the bottom of every chain is a Unix I/O event,
such as a network request, terminal input, file sync, or timer event. We push
every step in the path the request takes onto the chain until we get to the
terminal cause of the computation. Then we use this causal stack to route
results back to the caller.

The Arvo causal stack is called a `duct`. This is represented simply as a list
of [`wire`](#wire)s (paths), where each path represents a step in the causal
chain. The first element in the path is the vane handled that step in the
computation, or an empty string for Unix.

#### Source

```hoon
+$  duct  (list wire)
```

#### Examples

```
> `duct`-:~(tap in .^((set duct) %cx /=//=/tyre))
~[/gall/use/docket/0w3.kF2UY/~zod/tire /dill //term/1]
```

[%.y p=[#t/* q=0]]
```

---

## `+$goof`

Crash label and trace

#### Source

```hoon
+$  goof  [mote=term =tang]
```

#### Examples

```

#### Examples

```
> *mass
[p='' q=[%.n p=~]]

## `+$wire`

Event pretext

Type-wise, a `wire` is the same as a [`path`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/2q#path); a
`list` of [`knot`](/reference/hoon/stdlib/2q#knot)s with the syntax of
`/foo/bar/baz`. While a `path` is typically used in requests to denote a scry or
subscription endpoint, a `wire` is used for responses.

On the kernel-level, `wire`s are used in [`duct`](#duct)s to represent a causal
step in a call stack for routing purposes. In userspace, they're used the same
way under the hood, but practically speaking, they can be thought of as "tags"
for responses. That is, when you make a request to a vane of Gall agent, you
provide a `wire` for any responses you get back, and you can use this to
identity what the response is for.

> `wire`/foo/bar/baz
/foo/bar/baz
```

## `++wite`

Kernel action/error builder

This is used by the kernel in [`move`](#move)s. See the [`ball`](#ball) entry
for further details.

#### Source

```hoon
++  wite
  |$  ::  note: a routed $task
      ::  gift: a reverse action
      ::
      ::    NB:  task: a forward action
      ::         sign: a sourced $gift
      ::
      [note gift]
  $%  ::  %hurl: action failed
      ::  %pass: advance
      ::  %slip: lateral
      ::  %give: retreat
      ::
      [%hurl =goof wite=$;($>(?(%pass %give) $))]
      [%pass =wire =note]
      [%slip =note]
      [%give =gift]
  ==
```

#### Examples

```
> *(wite [vane=term task=maze] maze)
[%give gift=[%.y p=[#t/* q=0]]]
```

## `++en-beam`

Encode a [`beam`](#beam) in a `path`

#### Accepts

A [`beam`](#beam)

#### Produces

A `path`

#### Source

```hoon
++  en-beam
  |=(b=beam =*(s scot `path`[(s %p p.b) q.b (s r.b) s.b]))
```

#### Examples

```
> (en-beam [~zod %base da+now] /foo/bar)
/~zod/base/~2023.1.9..10.35.30..f55a/foo/bar
```

## `++de-beam`

Decode a [`beam`](#beam) from a `path`

#### Accepts

A `path`

#### Produces

A `beam` in a `unit`, which is null if parsing failed.

#### Source

```hoon
++  de-beam
  ~/  %de-beam
  |=  p=path
  ^-  (unit beam)
  ?.  ?=([@ @ @ *] p)  ~
  ?~  who=(slaw %p i.p)  ~
  ?~  des=?~(i.t.p (some %$) (slaw %tas i.t.p))  ~  :: XX +sym ;~(pose low (easy %$))
  ?~  ved=(de-case i.t.t.p)  ~
  `[[`ship`u.who `desk`u.des u.ved] t.t.t.p]
```

#### Examples

```
> (de-beam /~zod/base/~2023.1.9..10.35.30..f55a/foo/bar)
[~ [[p=~zod q=%base r=[%da p=~2023.1.9..10.35.30..f55a]] s=/foo/bar]]
```

## `++de-case`

Parse a [`case`](#case)

#### Accepts

A `knot`

#### Produces

A [`case`](#case) in a `unit`, which is null if parsing failed.

#### Source

```hoon
++  de-case
  ~/  %de-case
  |=  =knot
  ^-  (unit case)
  ?^  num=(slaw %ud knot)  `[%ud u.num]
  ?^  wen=(slaw %da knot)  `[%da u.wen]
  ?~  lab=(slaw %tas knot)  ~
  `[%tas u.lab]
```

#### Example

```
> (de-case '2')
[~ [%ud p=2]]

> (de-case '~2023.1.9..10.31.15..58ea')
[~ [%da p=~2023.1.9..10.31.15..58ea]]

> (de-case 'foo')
[~ [%tas p=%foo]]

> (de-case '!!!')
~
```
