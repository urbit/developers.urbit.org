Periodically, the Urbit Foundation has offered synchronous cohort classes which
cover the [Hoon School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then Hoon School Live
will be a good fit for you.  We seek to offer it a few times a year.

By completing Hoon School Live as a cohort student, you should be able to read and
interpret most nonspecialist Hoon code, produce useful standalone code, and
explain subject-oriented programming.  We omit some of the written Hoon School
content for time, but you should be well-equipped to understand the optional
lessons.

The cohort will start in September until October on Thursdays at 1pm EST | 6pm CEST.
