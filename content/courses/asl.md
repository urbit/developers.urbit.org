The Urbit Foundation offers cohort classes to cover the [App
School](/guides/core/hoon-school) curriculum jointly.

App School focuses on how to build a backend Gall agent, then on connecting it
to a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

The next cohort for App School Live will run in early 2023.

docs](/guides/core/app-school).
