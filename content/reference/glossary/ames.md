**Ames** is the name of the Urbit network and the
[vane](/reference/glossary/vane) that communicates over it. It's an encrypted
peer-to-peer network composed of instances of the
[Arvo](/reference/glossary/arvo) operating system. Each point
([galaxy](/reference/glossary/galaxy), [star](/reference/glossary/star),
[planet](/reference/glossary/planet), [moon](/reference/glossary/moon), or
[comet](/reference/glossary/comet)) communicates over the network utilizing the
Ames protocol.
