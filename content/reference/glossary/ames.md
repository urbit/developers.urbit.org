**Ames** is the name of the Urbit network and the [vane](/docs/glossary/vane) that communicates over it. It's an encrypted peer-to-peer network composed of instances of the [Arvo](/docs/glossary/arvo) operating system. Each [galaxy](/docs/glossary/galaxy), [star](/docs/glossary/star), [planet](/docs/glossary/planet), [moon](/docs/glossary/moon), and [comet](/docs/glossary/comet) communicates over the network utilizing the Ames protocol.

Your ship upgrades itself with [OTA updates](/docs/glossary/ota-updates) via communication over Ames. The web interface, [Landscape](/docs/glossary/landscape), of ships can be accessed by typing `sampel-palnet.arvo.network` into a browser, where `sampel-palnet` is the name of your ship.

Network continuity occasionally needs to be broken, either at an individual
level to fix networking issues or at a network-wide level to update Arvo beyond
what OTA updates are capable of doing. These events are called [factory resets](/docs/glossary/reset).
