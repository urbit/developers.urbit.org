The **Dojo** is Urbit's command-line application that processes system commands and returns output. It also runs [Hoon](/reference/glossary/hoon) and [Nock](/reference/glossary/nock) code, making it a good place to play around with those languages.

The other default command-line app is [Chat](/reference/glossary/chat). To switch between Dojo
and [Chat](/reference/glossary/chat) press Ctrl-X. The Dojo is the first thing you encounter after successfully booting your [ship](/reference/glossary/ship).
