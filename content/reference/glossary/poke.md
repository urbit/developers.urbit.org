A **poke** is a kind of `note` passed from one
[agent](/reference/glossary/agent) to another in a
[card](/reference/glossary/card). A poke is a one-off request/action, as opposed
to an ongoing subscription. A poke may contain any kind of data, and may go over
the network to remote ships. A poke is handled by the `++on-poke`
[arm](/reference/glossary/arm) of an agent.
