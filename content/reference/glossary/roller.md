A **roller** is a service that can be run on a [ship](/reference/glossary/ship)
that accepts [L2](/reference/glossary/rollups)
[Azimuth](/reference/glossary/azimuth) transactions, bundles them together, and
submits the batch to Azimuth on the Ethereum blockchain. Tlon runs the roller
used by the default [Bridge](/reference/glossary/bridge) instance at
[bridge.urbit.org](https://bridge.urbit.org), but anyone can run their own -
especially if they want to submit large volumes of transactions.
