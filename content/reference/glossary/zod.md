There are 256 [galaxies](/reference/glossary/galaxy), and `~zod` is the first:
number `0`. This galaxy is usually the first place core system updates are
published. Other galaxies then sync from `~zod` and distribute the update to
their children. A fake `~zod` is also conventionally used for testing by
developers.
