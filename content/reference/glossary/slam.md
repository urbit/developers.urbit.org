 **Slamming** a gate is another word for calling a gate with an argument. A gate
is [core](/reference/glossary/core) with one [arm](/reference/glossary/arm)
named `$` (buc). They are often called Hoon functions because they have many of
the same properties of functions from other programming languages.
