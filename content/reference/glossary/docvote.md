A **document proposal** is a type of [vote](/reference/glossary/voting) action taken by the [Galactic Senate](/reference/glossary/senate) over [Azimuth](/reference/glossary/azimuth). By passing a document proposal, [Galaxies](/reference/glossary/galaxy) in the Senate agree legitimize a document with arbitrary content. Such a document might make claims about the state of the world; an example document that would be subject to this type of vote might be a file that says, "@urbit_senate is the official Twitter account of the senate, and is to be managed by John Doe until further notice."
