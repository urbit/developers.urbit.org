**API** stands for "application programming interface". It refers to the
definitions and protocols that allow one application to communicate with
another. In Urbit, some notable APIs are the `task`s and `gift`s of
[vanes](/reference/glossary/vane) (kernel modules) and things like
[pokes](/reference/glossary/poke) for [Gall](/reference/glossary/gall)
[agents](/reference/glossary/agent).
