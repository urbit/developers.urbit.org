The [hood](/reference/glossary/hood) [agent](/reference/glossary/agent) is
divided into three separate sub-apps: `%drum`, `%kiln` and `%helm`. **Kiln** is
the part that handles [desk](/reference/glossary/desk) installation and updates,
and the running of the [agents](/reference/glossary/agent) they contain.
