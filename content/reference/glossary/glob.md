A **glob** is a bundle of front-end resources for an app which is served to a
web client by the `%docket` [agent](/reference/glossary/agent) in the
[%garden](/reference/glossary/garden) [desk](/reference/glossary/desk). The glob
will typically contain an `index.html` file, along with CSS, JS, and other
resources the web app needs. The glob for an app will be retrieved when you
install it, either over [Ames](/reference/glossary/ames) or from an external web
server.
