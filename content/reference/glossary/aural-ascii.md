The [Hoon](/reference/glossary/hoon) language makes extensive use of
non-alphanumeric symbols, most notably in composing
[runes](/reference/glossary/rune). When discussing Hoon code aloud, it is
cumbersome to say, for example, "exclamation mark left-angle bracket" in
reference to the `!<` rune. To make it easier, a set of monosyllabic names for
ASCII special symbols are conventionally used. In the `!<` example, this would
be called "zapgal", where `!` is "zap" and `<` is "gal".

Here is a complete list:

| Symbol      | Name |
|-------------|------|
| `␣` (space) | ace  |
| `\`         | bas  |
| `$`         | buc  |

| `:`         | col  |
| `,`         | com  |
| `"`         | doq  |
| `.`         | dot  |
| `/`         | fas  |
| `<`         | gal  |
| `␣␣`, `\0a`  | gap  |
| `>`         | gar  |
| `#`         | hax  |
| `-`         | hep  |
| `{`         | kel  |
| `}`         | ker  |
| `^`         | ket  |

| `@`         | pat  |
| `[`         | sel  |
| `]`         | ser  |
| `~`         | sig  |
| `'`         | soq  |
| `*`         | tar  |
| `` ` ``     | tic  |
