Clay is the primary filesystem for the [Arvo](/reference/arvo/overview)
operating system, which is the [core](/reference/glossary/core/) of an
urbit. The architecture of Clay is intrinsically connected with Arvo,
but for this section we assume no knowledge of either Arvo or Urbit.
We will point out only those features of Arvo that are necessary for
an understanding of Clay, and we will do so only when they arise.

The first relevant feature of Arvo is that it is a deterministic
system where input and output are defined as a series of events and
effects. The state of Arvo is simply a pure function of its event log.
None of the effects from an event are emitted until the event is
entered in the log and persisted, either to disk or another trusted
source of persistence, such as a Kafka cluster. Consequently, Arvo is
a single-level store: everything in its state is persistent.

In a more traditional OS, everything in RAM can be erased at any
time by power failure, and is always erased on reboot. Thus, a
primary purpose of a filesystem is to ensure files persist across
power failures and reboots. In Arvo, both power failures and
reboots are special cases of suspending computation, which is
done safely since our event log is already persistent. Therefore,
Clay is not needed in Arvo for persistence. Why, then, do we have a
filesystem? There are two answers to this question.

First, Clay provides a filesystem tree, which is a convenient
user interface for some applications. Unix has the useful concept
of virtual filesystems, which are used for everything from direct
access to devices, to random number generators, to the /proc
tree. It is easy and intuitive to read from and write to a
filesystem tree.

Second, Clay has a distributed revision-control system baked into
it. Traditional filesystems are not revision controlled, so
userspace software -- such as git -- is written on top of them to
do so. Clay natively provides the same functionality as modern
DVCSes, and more.

Clay has two other unique properties that we'll cover later on:
it supports typed data and is referentially transparent.

### Revision Control

Every urbit has one or more desks, which are independently
revision-controlled branches. Each desk contains its own `mark`
definitions, apps, and so forth.

Traditionally, an Urbit ship has at least a `%base` desk, and usually a
`%landscape` desk. The `%base` desk has the kernel and base system software.
The `%landscape` desk has software pertaining to the home screen. The `%base`
desk is a fork of the `%base` desk of whichever ship you download system
updates from - typically your sponsor, but theoretically may be any ship.

A desk is a series of numbered commits, the most recent of which
represents the current state of the desk. A commit is composed of
(1) an absolute time when it was created, (2) a list of zero or
more parents, and (3) a map from paths to data.

Most commits have exactly one parent, but the initial commit on a
desk may have zero parents, and merge commits have more than one
parent.

The non-metadata is stored as a `map` of `path`s to data. It's
worth noting that no constraints are put on this `map`, so, for
example, both `/a/b` and `/a/b/c` could have data. This is impossible
in a traditional Unix filesystem since it means that `/a/b` is both
a file and a directory. Conventionally, the final element in the
path is its `mark` -- much like a filename extension in Unix. Thus,
`/doc/readme.md` in Unix is stored as `/doc/readme/md` in urbit.

The data is not stored directly in the `map`; rather, a hash of the
data is stored, and we maintain a master blob store. Thus, if the
same data is referred to in multiple commits (as, for example,
when a file doesn't change between commits), only the hash is
duplicated.

In the master blob store, we either store the data directly, or
else we store a diff against another blob. The hash is dependent
only on the data within and not on whether or not it's stored
directly, so we may on occasion rearrange the contents of the
blob store for performance reasons.

Recall that a desk is a series of numbered commits. Not every
commit in a desk must be numbered. For example, if the `%base` desk
has had 50 commits since `%foo` was forked from it, then a merge
from `%base` to `%foo` will only add a single revision number,
although the full commit history will be accessible by traversing
the parentage of the individual commits.

We do guarantee that the first commit is numbered 1, commits are
numbered consecutively after that (i.e. there are no "holes"),
the topmost commit is always numbered, and every numbered commit
is an ancestor of every later numbered commit.

There are three ways to refer to particular commits in the
revision history. Firstly, one can use the revision number.
Secondly, one can use any absolute time between the one numbered
commit and the next (inclusive of the first, exclusive of the
second). Thirdly, every desk has a `map` of labels to revision
numbers. These labels may be used to refer to specific commits.

Additionally, Clay is a global filesystem, so data on other urbits
is easily accessible the same way as data on our local urbit. In
general, the path to a particular revision of a desk is
`/~urbit-name/desk-name/revision`. Thus, to get `/try/readme/md`
from revision 5 of the `%base` desk on `~sampel-sipnym`, we refer to
`/~sampel-sipnym/base/5/try/readme/md`. Clay's namespace is thus
global and referentially transparent.

### A Typed Filesystem

Since Clay is a general filesystem for storing data of arbitrary
types, in order to revision control correctly it needs to be
aware of types all the way through. Traditional revision control
does an excellent job of handling source code, so for source code
we act very similar to traditional revision control. The
challenge is to handle other data similarly well.

For example, modern VCSs generally support "binary files", which
are files for which the standard textual diffing, patching, and
merging algorithms are not helpful. A "diff" of two binary files
is just a pair of the files, "patching" this diff is just
replacing the old file with the new one, and "merging"
non-identical diffs is always a conflict, which can't even be
helpfully annotated. Without knowing anything about the structure
of a blob of data, this is the best we can do.

Often, though, "binary" files have some internal structure, and
it is possible to create diff, patch, and merge algorithms that
take advantage of this structure. An image may be the result of a
base image with some set of operations applied. With algorithms
aware of this set of operations, not only can revision control
software save space by not having to save every revision of the
image individually, these transformations can be made on parallel
branches and merged at will.

Suppose Alice is tasked with touching up a picture, improving the
color balance, adjusting the contrast, and so forth, while Bob
has the job of cropping the picture to fit where it's needed and
adding textual overlay. Without type-aware revision control,
these changes must be made serially, requiring Alice and Bob to
explicitly coordinate their efforts. With type-aware revision
control, these operations may be performed in parallel, and then
the two changesets can be merged programmatically.

Of course, even some kinds of text files may be better served by
diff, patch, and merge algorithms aware of the structure of the
files. Consider a file containing a pretty-printed JSON object.
Small changes in the JSON object may result in rather significant
changes in how the object is pretty-printed (for example, by
addding an indentation level, splitting a single line into
multiple lines).

A text file wrapped at 80 columns also reacts suboptimally with
unadorned Hunt-McIlroy diffs. A single word inserted in a
paragraph may push the final word or two of the line onto the
next line, and the entire rest of the paragraph may be flagged as
a change. Two diffs consisting of a single added word to
different sentences may be flagged as a conflict. In general,
prose should be diffed by sentence, not by line.

As far as we are aware, Clay is the first generalized,
type-aware revision control system. We'll go into the workings
of this system in some detail.

### Marks

Central to a typed filesystem is the idea of file types. In Clay, we
call these `mark`s. See the [Marks](/reference/arvo/clay/marks/marks)
section for more details.
